Hello World! My first personal Website is drafted.

<!--- In 2003 or 2004, I had built a webiste as a teenager. Back then I used [Microsoft Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage), which did not make it a lot easier really, and the website was rather ugly.

Now I wondered how hard it could be to build a website today in 2022, almost 20 years later. I stumbled over [`Jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/) and its [`al-folio`](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio#al-folio) theme and decided to give it a try over the weekend. This website is the result. I think the people developing and mentaining the software did a great job and it is awesome how easy it was to set this up. -->
