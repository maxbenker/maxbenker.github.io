I am an engineer currently pursuing a PhD in the field of manufacturing at the [Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management](https://www.mec.ed.tum.de/en/iwb/homepage/) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My research is about condition moitoring of machine tool feed drives and methods for the estimation of remaining useful life (RUL). Check out my [publications](/publications/) for details. Prior to the PhD program at TUM I studied industrial engineering and management at Technical University of Berlin and did interships in the automotive and consumer goods industry. 
My research interests include manufacturing, condition monitoring of machine tools, applied Bayesian methods, applied machine learning and data analytics.  

Opinions are my own and not the views of my employer.
